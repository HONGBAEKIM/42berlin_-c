//code uses poll() for I/O multiplexing. 
//The poll function is used to monitor multiple file descriptors (sockets) for events, 
//making it an I/O multiplexing mechanism. Here's how the code incorporates I/O multiplexing:

//To set up I/O multiplexing in your server:

    //1. Choose an I/O Model: Decide between select(), poll(), epoll() (Linux-specific), or kqueue() (BSD-specific). 
    //Each has its advantages depending on your use case.

    //2. Implement Non-blocking Sockets: Configure your sockets to non-blocking mode.
    //This allows your server to handle other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete.

    //3. Integrate with Your Server Loop: Incorporate the chosen I/O multiplexing function into your server's main loop. 
    //This function will monitor multiple file descriptors to see if they are ready for I/O operations (like reading or writing).

    //4. Handle I/O Events: When the I/O multiplexing function indicates a file descriptor is ready, 
    //perform the necessary read or write operations.

    //5. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling, ensuring 
    //that your server can handle multiple clients and various I/O scenarios without crashing.
